Navigate to:    Procedural/3D Shapes Procedural/Debug

Double-click on "3D Shapes Procedural.exe"

A console window should pop-up, then the demo should show shortly after.

This has been tested under the following machines:
windows 7 64bit
Windows 8 32bit
Windows 7 32bit (Fresh install)

So it should run for any Windows OS.

The following files worth looking at from here are:
    // Handles the running of the demo
    ProceduralDemo.h
    ProceduralDemo.cpp
    
    // Represents a single shape that is drawn to the screen
    ProceduralShape.h
    ProceduralShape.cpp

Navigate to:  Procedural/3D Shapes Procedural

Open up "3D Shapes Procedural.sln" in Visual Studios 2013 (VS 2015 should work fine too)

Compile for the Debug version for best results. Reslease should work too.
